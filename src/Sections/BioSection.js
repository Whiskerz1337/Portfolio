        Hi, I&apos;m Luke, a Melbourne based cybersecurity student from the UK with a passion for
        penetration testing, problem-solving, and software development. As a strong communicator, I
        can effectively collaborate with diverse teams and clients in the ever-evolving world of
        digital security.
        <br />
        <br />
        My love for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges has honed my critical thinking skills, while
        working on both team-based and solo projects in my spare time has contributed positively to
        my skillset. This blend of theoretical and hands-on experience fuels my ambition to become a
        highly-skilled cybersecurity professional.
