        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          Hi, I&apos;m Luke, a British cybersecurity student and versatile software developer based
          in Melbourne, Australia. My unrelenting passion for technology has driven me to merge my
          expertise in cybersecurity with my proficiency in software development.

        <br></br>
        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          Having successfully completed the Certificate IV in Cybersecurity, I&apos;m now pursuing
          the Advanced Diploma in Cybersecurity to further expand my knowledge. My proficiency in
          various programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Bash, JSX, and Rust, keeps me
          at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.

        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          Over the years, I&apos;ve sharpened my hardware expertise by assembling and repairing
          numerous custom-built PCs. This hands-on experience has not only deepened my understanding
          of computer systems but also reinforced the significance of robust cybersecurity measures.
        </p>

        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          I am an ardent advocate for learning through hands-on experiences and take immense
          pleasure in diving into personal and collaborative projects. By actively engaging in
          opportunities to tackle complex problems, I continually broaden my skillset in areas such
          as software and web development, which includes Node.js, React, React-Native, Redux,
          Express, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          In the realm of cybersecurity, I am knowledgeable in incident response frameworks like
          MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, and NIST guidelines. My strong communication skills enable
          me to collaborate effectively within diverse teams and share my insights with others.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p className='text-center font-roboto text-xl leading-relaxed text-primary'>
          As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to secure an entry-level role in
          the cybersecurity field, where I can harness my unique fusion of cybersecurity and
          software development expertise. With my unwavering passion, exceptional problem-solving
          abilities, and keen enthusiasm for learning, I am confident in my ability to leave a
          lasting impact on any organization I join.
